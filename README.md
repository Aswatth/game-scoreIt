## Working:
  <b>Default mode:</b>
  <p>
    The ball is spawned at the center of the field and the goals posts are spawned alternativly on either side of the field in predetermined positions.
    Players can drag touch and drag their finger to set the direction and force with which the ball should be shot.
    The timer starts when player scores the first goal and will be reset for every goal.
    To determine perfect goals, the ball's collision against the goals post is checked, if it has not collided prior to the goal then the goal is considered as a pefect goal and three points are added to the score with a confetti celebration.
